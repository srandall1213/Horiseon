# Horiseon 

## Description

*My motivation in completing this project was to learn how to apply concepts we learned in class and gain some experience. 
*I built this project because I wanted to be able to make the code easier to read and more accessible while keeping the formatting the same. 
*The problems solved while working on this project were adding semantic elements, arranging elements to follow a logical structure, adding accessible alt attributes, giving the page a proper title, correcting a page link, and inserting CSS comments.
*Through this project I learned how to link a section of page to the nav bar, how to commit changes to GitHub, and how to make the website live.
*My project may stand out because I tried to increase the efficiency of the CSS by organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elemtns and included comments. 
*I faced a challenge with getting the cover photo linked to the HTML instead of the CSS. I couldn't copy and paste it over. I had to find the image's relative path. I am also still learning that multiple codes can do the same thing and trying to figure out which ways are more proper. 
*Features I would like to implement in the future would be to insert a video, contact information for the company, and a 'Ask a Question' form.
